#### Classification based project
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evan-Quek/Evan-Quek/main/images/Panamax_rf.PNG)

In this project, a port operator is facing port congestion due to lack of visibility of incoming vessels' dwell time. Random Forest classifier was applied to predict vessels which are more likely to have delays in dwelling to assist client in resource planning for better port performance, thus reducing port congestions by improving vessels turnaround time.

#### Time-Based Regression project

In order to further enhance the visibility to ease port congestion, a Lasso regression model was used to predict incoming containers. If the number of containers fall short of the predicted value, it will cause congestions on the following week when the delayed containers reaches the port. Pre-emptive measures such as allocating more cranes and manpower can be done if such situation develops.
