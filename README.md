I am Evan Quek, a technical analyst trader with ~5 years of progressive experience in futures markets. I am involved in trading system development, analysis of trading results, and actual trade execution in PATS and CQG platforms.

I am fresh out from BCG RISE Business and Data Analytics program. The course ignited my internal passion for python coding and I am looking to bring forward this new skill for the greater good.
